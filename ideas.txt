Make more emitters.

- spiraling emitter pattern
- pulsed emitter
- repulsion from the center of the screen
- more ideas from The Coding Train videos
- fireworks in various colors, shapes, sizes, and effects (e.g. some real fireworks sparkle shortly before going out)
- different emitter shapes: rings, squares, stars, ... (the default is the emitter position point)
- try different distributions: beta, uniform, etc. The beta distribution can look like the normal distribution with lower and upper limits.
- random wind force for flickering fire?
- fire.py with BLEND_RGBA_MAX looks cool
- Portals from Doctor Strange


Make a gui with pygame_gui:
- Display misc info.
- Choose the type of simulation.
- Show instructions for and info about the chosen simulation.
- Change simulation parameters:
  - Particles per second
  - ? (others, depending on the chosen simulation)
- Pause/unpause
- Save as image.
